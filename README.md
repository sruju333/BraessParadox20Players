Given a finite n-player strategic form game, develop a program that outputs:
* all strongly dominant strategies;
* all weakly dominant strategies;
* all very weakly dominant strategies;
* a strongly dominant strategy equilibrium, if one exists;
* all weakly dominant strategy equilibria, if they exist;
* all very weakly dominant strategy equilibria, if they exist; and
* all pure strategy Nash equilibria, if they exist.
* maxmin values of all players and all their maxmin strategies
* minmax values of all players and all minmax strategy profiles against each player.
